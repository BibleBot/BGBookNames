BGBookNames
===========

A quick way of getting all the book names from all of Bible Gateway's versions. It's self-optimizing, removing duplicates and error resolution interactively (i.e. when it gets a book name that it doesn't know about). It takes about 72s to run, but I have plans to make this multithreaded.
